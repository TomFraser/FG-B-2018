This library was written specifically for the TEENSy 3.0 SPI.  It will not work on Arduino or any other system.

This library supports using the alternate SPI pins, the gray pins on the pinout diagram.

***
It should be noted that I experienced some problems when using SLAVE mode, with 8 bit frames,
with a large array length, at the fastest clock rate.  I was able to go to the next clock
divider (SPI_CLOCK_DIV4	= 12.0	MHz) and this solved my problem.  I can also use a smaller
array length with no issues.  I think that at very high speed, with short frame size, the
master SPI can over-run my slave ISR scan time.

***
The SLAVE "return data" is loaded every time the ISR is called.  So on the first byte received,
there will be no data loaded into the "return data" register.  So expect no return data (zero's)
on the very first frame transferred.

***
Many slave devices require that the CS pin stay active until several bytes have been transfered.
For these, it may be useful to specify your own CS pin and do a digitalWrite(CSpin, state) outside
of the tx function.

Example:
	digitalWrite(CS18, LOW);
	t3SPI.tx8(data1, CTARn, CS);
	t3SPI.tx8(data2, CTARn, CS);
	digitalWrite(CS18, HIGH);
